ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

From BaseGameUtils:
* build.xml
* proguard-project.txt
From google_play_services_lib:
* R.txt
* build.xml
* proguard-project.txt
* proguard.txt

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

In google_play_services_lib:
* AndroidManifest.xml => google_play_services_lib/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
* libs/google-base.jar => google_play_services_lib/libs/google-base.jar
* libs/google-basement.jar => google_play_services_lib/libs/google-basement.jar
* libs/google-games.jar => google_play_services_lib/libs/google-games.jar
* libs/google-plus.jar => google_play_services_lib/libs/google-plus.jar
* res/ => google_play_services_lib/src/main/res/
* src/ => google_play_services_lib/src/main/java
* src/.gitkeep => google_play_services_lib/src/main/resources/.gitkeep
In BaseGameUtils:
* AndroidManifest.xml => baseGameUtils/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
* libs/arch-libs.jar => baseGameUtils/libs/arch-libs.jar
* libs/support-v4.jar => baseGameUtils/libs/support-v4.jar
* res/ => baseGameUtils/src/main/res/
* src/ => baseGameUtils/src/main/java/

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

(This import summary is for your information only, and can be deleted
after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
